msgid "Boolean mode"

msgid "Summary"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mroonga can perform boolean full text searches using the ``IN BOOLEAN MODE`` "
"modifier for ``MATCH AGAINST``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, ``IN BOOLEAN MODE`` is suitable rather than the default ``IN "
"NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE``. Because ``IN BOOLEAN MODE`` is similar to query in "
"Web search engine. Most people familiar with query in Web search engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use `qualifiers which MySQL support <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/"
"refman/5.7/en/fulltext-boolean.html>`_ and Mroonga original pragmas in "
"boolean full text search query."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These qualifiers and pragmas can change the relative rank of search results."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the case of a search string not using neither a qualifier nor a pragma, "
"the search results that contain the search string will be rated higher."
msgstr ""

msgid "Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are schema and data to show examples::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Qualifier"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are supported qualifiers."
msgstr ""

msgid "``KEYWORD1 KEYWORD2``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No operator between keywords such as ``KEYWORD1 KEYWORD2`` indicates that "
"one of keywords must be present in each row that is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Mroonga for`` query means that ``Mroonga`` or ``for`` must be present::"
msgstr ""

msgid "``KEYWORD1 OR KEYWORD2``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``OR`` (must be uppercase) indicates that left hand side keyword or right "
"hand side keyword must be present in each row that is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Mroonga OR for`` query means that ``Mroonga`` or ``for`` must be present::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``OR`` is the default operator. You can omit it. Both ``Mroonga OR for`` and "
"``Mroonga for`` return the same result."
msgstr ""

msgid "``+KEYWORD``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading plus sign indicates that this word must be present in each row "
"that is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``+MySQL +Mroonga`` query means that both ``MySQL`` and ``Mroonga`` must be "
"present::"
msgstr ""

msgid "``-KEYWORD``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading minus sign indicates that this word must not be present in any of "
"the rows that are returned."

"A following asterisk indicates that all words starting with this word must "
"be present in any of the rows that are returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``+M*`` query means that words starting ``M`` (``MySQL`` and ``Mroonga`` in "
"this case) must be present::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To be precise, \"word\" may not be \"word\" you think. \"word\" in this "
"context is \"token\". \"token\" may not be word. For example, tokens in "
"\"It's\" are \"It\", \"'\" and \"s\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can confirm token by :doc:`/reference/udf/mroonga_command` and `tokenize "
"<http://groonga.org/docs/reference/commands/tokenize.html>`_::"
msgstr ""

msgid "JSON value in the above result is formatted by hand."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"PHRASE\"``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Quoting phrase by double quote (``\"``) indicates that the phrase must be "
"present in any of the rows that are returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``+\"Professional MySQL\"`` query means that ``Professional MySQL`` phrase "
"must be present. The query doesn't match to ``MySQL for Profession``. "
"``MySQL for Profession`` includes both ``MySQL`` and ``Professional`` words "

msgid "Here is the result of the query::"

msgid "Pragma"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pragma is metadata for query. You can change how to parse query by "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can embed pragma at the head of query for specifying how to execute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pragma must exist in the beginning of a query. Don't put a blank into a head "
"of the query. Pragma starts with ``*``::"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can specify multiple pragmas::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are available pragmas."
msgstr ""

msgid "``D`` pragma"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``D`` pragma indicates the default operator. It's used when an individual "
"operator is omitted."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``W`` pragma indicates target section and its weight for multiple column "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can specify different weight for each section. The default weight is "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here are schema and data to show examples. You need to create a multiple "
"column index to use ``W`` pragma::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is an example to show how to use weight. ``title`` column has ``10`` "
"weight and ``content`` columns has ``1`` weight. It means that keyword in "
"``title`` column is 10 times important than keyword in ``content`` column::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The score of the first record is ``0``. Because it doesn't have any "
"``Groonga`` in both ``title`` column and ``content`` column."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The score of the second record is ``11``. Because it has ``Groonga`` in both "
"``title`` column and ``content`` column. ``Groonga`` in ``title`` column has "
"score ``10``. ``Groonga`` in ``content`` column has score ``1``. ``11`` is "
"sum of them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The score of the third record is ``1``. Because it has ``Groonga`` in only "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Near search matches only when there are 10 or less words between specified "
