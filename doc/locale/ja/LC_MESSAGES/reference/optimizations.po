msgid "Mroonga implemented some optimizations to return response faster."

msgid "Some optimizations can work only on :doc:`/tutorial/storage`."

msgid "Fetching only needed columns"

msgid ""
"Groonga uses column store architecture. It means that Groonga doesn't need "
"to fetch values of all columns for fetching a column value in a row. Groonga "
"can fetch values of only needed columns."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"InnoDB and MyISAM use row store architecture. They need to fetch values of "
"all columns for fetching a column value in a row."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you specify only columns you needed in ``SELECT``, Mroonga just fetches "
"only values of these columns. Mroonga doesn't fetch values of other columns."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mroonga can work faster by reducing operations and I/O."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's this optimization."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is a sample table definition to describe this optimization::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is a ``SELECT`` to describe this optimization::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case, Mroonga fetches values from only ``c1``, ``c2``, ``c11`` and "
"``c12``. Mroonga doesn't fetch values from ``c3``, ``c4``, ..., ``c10``, "
"``c13``, ..., ``c19`` and ``c20``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Row count"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"MySQL requires all column values from storage engine for processing "
"``COUNT(*)`` even if ``COUNT(*)`` doesn't need them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mroonga doesn't fetch any column values for the case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``SELECT`` fetches only ``COUNT(*)`` and condition in ``WHERE`` can be "
"processed only by index. In this case, Mroonga uses this optimization."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can confirm whether this optimization is used or not by looking :ref:"
"`status-variable-mroonga-count-skip` status variable::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`status-variable-mroonga-count-skip` status variable is incremented "
"when Mroonga uses this optimization."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can disable this optimization by setting :ref:`server-variable-mroonga-"
"enable-optimization` to ``false``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``ORDER BY LIMIT``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This optimization can work on both :doc:`/tutorial/storage` and :doc:`/"
"tutorial/wrapper`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"MySQL can process ``ORDER BY`` and ``LIMIT`` with low cost if you can get "
"sorted records by index even if the number of matched records is very big."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"MySQL can do the process for ``MATCH() AGAINST(IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE)``. "
"But MySQL can't do the process for ``MATCH() AGAINST(IN BOOLEAN MODE)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It means that MySQL might take long time for ``MATCH() AGAINST(IN BOOLEAN "
"MODE)`` that matches with many records."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mroonga processes ``ORDER BY`` and ``LIMIT`` by Groonga and returns only "
"target records to MySQL. It's very faster for query that matches with many "
"records."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``SELECT`` runs full text search and sorts by Groonga and returns only "
"one record to MySQL."

":ref:`status-variable-mroonga-fast-order-limit` status variable is "
"incremented when Mroonga uses this optimization."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This optimization is used only when all the following conditions are true:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":doc:`/tutorial/storage`: ``WHERE`` clause has one ``MATCH AGAINST`` and "
"zero or more arithmetic operations such as ``column < 100``."
msgstr ""

msgid ":doc:`/tutorial/wrapper`: ``WHERE`` clause has only ``MATCH AGAINST``."
msgstr ""

msgid "No ``JOIN``"

msgid "No ``SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS``"

msgid "With ``LIMIT``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":doc:`/tutorial/storage`: ``ORDER BY`` clause has only columns or ``MATCH "
"AGAINST`` that is used in ``WHERE`` clause."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":doc:`/tutorial/wrapper`: ``ORDER BY`` clause has only primary column or "
"``MATCH AGAINST`` that is used in ``WHERE`` clause."
