Windows
=======

This section describes how to install Mroonga on Windows. You can
install Mroogna by extracting a zip package.

Mroonga binary for Windows is provided with MariaDB binary because
`some changes
<https://github.com/mroonga/mroonga/tree/master/packages/source/patches>`_
are needed for building Mroonga for Windows.

.. include:: 32bit-note.inc

Installer
---------

.. caution::

   The following MSI files don't work yet. Please use zip files below
   or help us to creating MSI files that work well.

Download MSI file and execute it. You need to choose a MSI for your
environment.

Choose ``win32`` version for 32-bit environment, ``winx64`` version
for 64-bit environment:

  * `mariadb-10.0.10-with-mroonga-4.02-win32.msi <https://github.com/mroonga/mroonga/releases/download/v4.02/mariadb-10.0.10-with-mroonga-4.02-win32.msi>`_
  * `mariadb-10.0.10-with-mroonga-4.02-winx64.msi <https://github.com/mroonga/mroonga/releases/download/v4.02/mariadb-10.0.10-with-mroonga-4.02-winx64.msi>`_

Zip
---

Download zip file and extract it. You need to choose a zip for your
environment:

  * |mroonga_mariadb_windows_package_link|

Zip packages are pre-configured for easy to use, so no need to execute
``INSTALL PLUGIN`` and ``CREATE FUNCTION``.

Just start mysqld by following command::

  > mysqld.exe --defaults-file=.\MY-PREFERRED-INI.ini --console

Each zip package contains ini files (my-small.ini, my-medium.ini,
my-large.ini and so on), choose preferred ini file which meets on your
demand.

Next connect to MariaDB by following command::

  > mysql.exe
  MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW ENGINES;

Build from source with MariaDB
------------------------------

You need to use Mroonga bundled MariaDB source provided by the Mroonga
project.

You can find it in
`<https://packages.groonga.org/source/mroonga/>`_. Mroonga bundled
MariaDB source has
``mariadb-${MARIADB_VERSION}-with-mroonga-${MROONGA_VERSION}.zip``
file name.

You can build the source code with `the standard MariaDB build process
<https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/documentation/getting-started/compiling-mariadb-from-source/Building_MariaDB_on_Windows/>`_.

You need to register Mroonga after building MariaDB. Use SQL at
``${MARIADB_BUILD_DIR}\storage\mroonga\data\install.sql`` to register
Mroonga.
