.. _release-11-04:

Release 11.04 - 2021-06-29
--------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [:doc:`/reference/server_variables`] We disabled ``mroonga_enable_operations_recording`` by default.

  ``mroonga_enable_operations_recording`` to determine whether recording operations for auto recovering are enabled or not. 

  This recording of operations is for auto recovering Mroonga when it crashed.
  Normally, if lock remain in Mroonga, we can't execute INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE, but if ``mroonga_enable_operations_recording`` is enable, we may not execute SELECT at times in addition to INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE.
  Because auto recovery is sometimes blocked by residual lock when they crashed.

  Therefore, we set ``OFF`` to the default value in this version.
  By we disable operation recording, INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE is blocked as usual because of the residual lock, but "SELECT" may bework.

  An appropriate way to handle to residual lock is as follows.

    * https://www.clear-code.com/blog/2021/6/1/mroonga-recover-lock-failed-2021.html
      (Japanese only)

* [:doc:`/install/debian`] Added a install procedure for Mroonga for Debian GNU/Linux with Oracle MySQL package.

  We supoort Mroonga for Debian GNU/Linux with Oracle MySQL package in Mroonga 11.03.
  We wrote install procedure for these package to this documentation.
  When we will install these packages, please refer to this documentation.

* [:doc:`/install/centos`] Added support for MariaDB 10.2.39, 10.3.30, 10.4.20, and 10.5.11.

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fix a crash bag when we execute search

  **This issue doesn't occur under normal use.**

  The occurrence condition is as below.

    * We directly make tables and columns on Groonga by using ``mroonga_command``.
    * We execute search at the same time as delete the above tables and columns.

  When the above conditions are established, Mroonga might crash.

.. _release-11-03:

Release 11.03 - 2021-05-31
--------------------------

  .. warning::

     This release has had a critical bug about uninstall and upgrade.
     If we install this version, we fail upgrade Mroonga and also uninstall it.

     Therefore, please don't use Mroonga of this version.

     If we have already installed Mroonga of this version, we can upgrade Mroonga or uninstall it by using the following workaround. 

       1. % echo "#\!/bin/sh" > /usr/share/mroonga/deb/postrm.sh
       2. % chmod u+x /usr/share/mroonga/deb/postrm.sh
       3. Upgrade Mroonga or uninstall Mroonga.

  .. warning::

     The package names are changed from this release.
     Mroonga may be invalid after upgrade to this version by the influence of this modification.
     If we upgrade to this version, please always be sure to confirm the below points.

     If Mroonga is invalid after the upgrade, we need to install manually Mroonga again.
     Please refer to the following URL about the manual installation of Mroonga and how to confirming whether Mroonga is valid or not.

       * https://mroonga.org/docs/tutorial/installation_check.html

     Besides, please be careful the above phenomenon will continue from now if we will upgrade mroonga to stride over a Mroonga 11.03.

     If Mroonga is valid after upgrade to this version but, Mroonga's version is old, we need to restart MySQL, MariaDB, or PerconaServer.
     We can confirm Mroonga's version as the below command.

       * ``SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'mroonga_version';``

  .. warning::

       There are broken backward compatibility on this version.

       Users that are using GEOMETRY type need to store the current data
       before upgrading to Mroonga 11.03 and restore the stored data
       after upgrading to Mroonga 11.03.

       Please be careful if we upgrade to this version without executing the above procedure,
       data is broken.

       Users can use the following methods for dumping/restoring data.

         * mysqldump
         * Execute ALTER TABLE ENGINE=InnoDB before upgrading and
           execute ALTER TABLE ENGINE=Mroonga after upgrading.

       If without this fix, INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT/SELECT works well
       but data stored in Groonga are wrong (Latitude and longitude are swapped in Groonga).
       Therefore, mroonga_command('select ...') doesn「t work for spatial data.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Renamed package names as below.

  * ``mariadb-server-10.x-mroonga`` -> ``mariadb-10.x-mroonga``
  * ``mysql-server-5.x-mroonga`` -> ``mysql-community-5.x-mroonga``
  * ``mysql-server-8.x-mroonga`` -> ``mysql-community-8.x-mroonga``
  * ``percona-server-5x-mroonga`` -> ``percona-server-5.x-mroonga``
  * ``percona-server-8x-mroonga`` -> ``percona-server-8.x-mroonga``

* [:doc:`/install/debian`] Added support for the Oracle MySQL 5.7 package and the Oracle MySQL 8.0 package.

  * In this release, we newly provided the package of Mroonga for Debian GNU/Linux with the Oracle MySQL 5.7 and the Oracle MySQL 8.0.

    * By this, we make the Docker image of Mroonga with MySQL for Docker official images.

  * There are below restrictions in the MySQL8 package.

    * [:doc:`/tutorial/wrapper`] Wrapper mode is not supported yet.
    * [:doc:`/tutorial/storage`] Storage mode does not support the following feature.

      * The feature of relevant to the optimization.

* Added support for the SRID of Spatial Indexes.

  * the index of Mroonga is used in search with ``MBRContains`` function on MySQL 8.x since this release.

* We added condition expressions that are applied condition push down.

  .. note::

     Condition push down doesn't evaluate condition expressions in MySQL, but it evaluate condition expressions in Mroonga.
     Therefore, more queries will become high-performance, but the result of search may different than usual by Mroonga evaluate them.
     If Mroonga returns unexpected search results, we request that you report from the below URL.
     And we would like you to invalid for condition push down.

       * https://github.com/mroonga/mroonga/issues/

     We can invalid condition push down as below.

       * ``SET GLOBAL mroonga_condition_push_down_type = "NONE"``

* [:doc:`/install/centos`] Added support for Percona Server 8.0.23

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug that latitude and longitude are stored conversely.

  .. warning::

     backward compatibility is broken by this fix.

     Users that are using ``GEOMETRY`` type need to store the current data before upgrading to Mroonga 11.03 and restore the stored data after upgrading to Mroonga 11.03.
     Users can use the following methods for dumping/restoring data.

       * ``mysqldump``
       * Execute ``ALTER TABLE ENGINE=InnoDB`` before upgrading and execute ``ALTER TABLE ENGINE=Mroonga`` after upgrading.

     If without this fix, ``INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT/SELECT`` works well but data stored in Groonga are wrong (Latitude and longitude are swapped in Groonga). Therefore, ``mroonga_command('select ...')`` doesn't work for spatial data.

.. _release-11-02:

Release 11.02 - 2021-05-10

* Added support for adding value with text in JSON format to reference vector columns as below.

  * It makes easier to add JSON data into reference columns by this feature.
    Because we can directly add values to columns for reference destination from the source table.

  .. code-block::

     CREATE TABLE attributes (
       _id int,
       name varchar(255),
       value varchar(255)
     ) DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

* Fixed a bug that FOREIGN KEY constraint was not registered. [GitHub#393][Reported by Kosuke Yamashita]

  * This bug had only occurred on MySQL 8.0.
  * For example, the FOREIGN KEY constraint information had not been outputted even if we define it as below.

    .. code-block::

       CREATE TABLE referred (
         id int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
       );

.. _release-11-00:

Release 11.00 - 2021-02-09
--------------------------

This is a major version up! But It keeps backward compatibility.
You can upgrade to 11.00 without rebuilding database.

In this version, MySQL, MariaDB, or PerconaServer will be automatically restarted.
Because Mroonga 11.00 requires Groonga 11.0.0 or later but it will not reloaded

  * Because it reached EOL at Feb 1, 2021.

* [:doc:`/install/centos`] Dropped support for Percona Server 5.6

* Dropped support for MariaDB 10.1 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

  * Because MariaDB 10.1 already has reached EOL in upstream.

* Fixed a bug that we can't use in place ``ALTER TABLE`` when we modify the data type of a column that has any indexes.

  * This bug occur when we execute ``ALTER TABLE`` in ``ALGORITHM=INPLACE``.
    Therefore, this bug doesn't occur when we use ``ALTER TABLE`` in ``ALGORITHM=COPY``

.. _release-10-10:

Release 10.10 - 2020-12-29
--------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [:doc:`/tutorial/storage`] Added support for customize table flags. [Gitter][Reported by Shinichi Takayanagi]

Release 8.01 - 2018-03-29
-------------------------

In this version, MySQL will be automatically restarted if you had
