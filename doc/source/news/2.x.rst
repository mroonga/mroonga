.. _release-2-09:

Release 2.09 - 2012/11/29
-------------------------

.. caution::

   This release has backward incompatible changes against ``TIMESTAMP``
   value and primary indexed char(N).

   ``TIMESTAMP`` value is changed to store as UTC timezone.
   If you have any table that uses ``TIMESTAMP`` column with no UTC timezone,
   please recreate (dump and restore) database.

   If you have any table that uses char(N) as primary key,
   please recreate index.

   Here is a procedure how to recreate database or recreate index.

Dump a database that uses mroonga::

  % mysqldump MY_MROONGA_DATABASE > database-mroonga.dump

Restore a database by modified dump file::

  % mysql -u root MY_MROONGA_DATABASE < database-mroonga.dump

Recreate a index::

   mysql> ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY;
   mysql> ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name);

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [rpm][centos] Supported MySQL 5.5.28 on CentOS 5.
* [rpm][centos] Supported MySQL 5.1.61 on CentOS 6.
* [wrapper mode] Supported last_insert_id() [#1540] [Reported by @soundkitchen]

  [#1533] [Reported by @HANZUBON]
* Fixed a bug that primary indexed char(N) can't be searched.
  This bug affects if any value of char(N) has M-length (M < N) string or
  it has one more spaces at the last and require index recreation.
* Fixed a bug that content after NULL character is ignored for char(N)
* Fixed to store ``TIMESTAMP`` value as UTC timezone.
  This is backward incompatible change.

.. _release-2-05:

Release 2.05 - 2012/07/29
-------------------------

.. caution::

   This release has a backward incompatible change against SET column
   and ENUM.
   If you use SET column or ENUM that has the number of elements < 256
   in :doc:`/tutorial/storage`, please recreate (dump and restore)
   database.

Here is upgrade sequence.

Dump a database that uses mroonga::

  % mysqldump MY_MROONGA_DATABASE > database-mroonga.dump

Drop the existing database::

  % mysql -u root -e 'DROP DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'

You must upgrade to "mroonga" storage engine. Use
``apt-get`` on Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu and ``yum`` on
CentOS or Fedora.

apt-get::

  % sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server-mroonga

yum (upgrade from mroonga release prior to v2.02)::

  % sudo yum remove -y mysql-mroonga
  % sudo yum install -y mysql-mroonga

yum (upgrade from mroonga release v2.03 or later)::

  % sudo yum install -y mysql-mroonga

.. caution::

   Don't forget to run ``yum remove`` before ``yum
   install`` if you upgrade mroonga prior to v2.02 release.
   If you forget to run ``yum remove``, we will break
   a MySQL's system table.

Recreate a database::

  % mysql -u root -e 'CREATE DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'

Restore a database by modified dump file::

  % mysql -u root MY_MROONGA_DATABASE < database-mroonga.dump

Now, we can use mroonga 2.05.

* [storage mode] Supported index for SET column.
* [rpm] Supported MySQL 5.5.25a.

.. _release-2-00:

Release 2.00 - 2012/02/29
-------------------------

.. caution::

   This release breaks backward compatibility. We need to
   dump and restore our database for upgrading.

In this release, mroonga has two changes that requires
database recreation:

1. Supported all characters for database, table and column
   names.
2. Groonga's native time data type is used for ``YEAR`` type
   in MySQL.

Here are upgrade sequence.

We dump a database that uses mroonga::

  % mysqldump MY_MROONGA_DATABASE > database-mroonga.dump

We drop the existing database::

  % mysql -u root -e 'DROP DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'

We upgrade to "mroonga" storage engine. We will use
``apt-get`` on Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu and ``yum`` on
CentOS or Fedora.

apt-get::

  % sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server-mroonga

yum::

  % sudo yum remove -y mysql-mroonga
  % sudo yum install -y mysql-mroonga

.. caution::

   We don't forget to run ``yum remove`` before ``yum
   install``. If we forget to run ``yum remove``, we will break
   a MySQL's system table.

We recreate a database::

  % mysql -u root -e 'CREATE DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'

We restore a database by modified dump file::

  % mysql -u root MY_MROONGA_DATABASE < database-mroonga.dump

Now, we can use mroonga 2.00.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Supported MySQL 5.5.21.
* Required groonga 2.0.0 or later.
* Supported TIMESTAMP with fractional seconds on MySQL 5.6 and MariaDB.
* [storage mode] Supported ``ORDER LIMIT`` optimization on no primary key.
* [storage mode] Supported ``ORDER LIMIT`` optimization with
  fulltext search and ``COLUMN = INT_VALUE``.
* [storage mode] Supported fulltext search in sub query.
  [Reported by @camyuy]
* [incompatible] Mapped ``YEAR`` in MySQL to ``Time`` in
  groonga to improve groonga integration.
* [storage mode] Removed a needless write lock on update.
  [#1271] [Reported by Takahiro Nagai]
* Added ``mroonga_enable_optimization`` system variable to
  on/off optimization. It's useful for benchmark.
* [wrapper mode] Supported temporary table. [#1267]
* [incompatible] Supported ``/`` in database name. [#1281]
* Suppressed needless messages on ``INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE
  KEY UPDATE``.
* Supported ``INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`` with
  ``UNIQUE KEY``. [#1283] [Reported by @104yuki_n]
* Supported ``DATETIME``, ``DATE``, ``TIMESTAMP``, ``TIME``,
  ``DECIMAL``, ``YEAR`` for primary key.
* [incompatible] Supported all characters for database, table and
  column names. [#1284]
* [wrapper mode] Supported 255 bytes over index. [#1282]
* [wrapper mode] Supported updating primary key. [#1195]
* [wrapper mode] Supported error handling on ``ALTER TABLE``. [#1195]
* [wrapper mode] Improved error message on unsupported
  geometry type like ``LineString``. [#1195]
