.. _release-8-01:

Release 8.01 - 2018-03-29
-------------------------

In this version, MySQL will be automatically restarted if you had
already installed Mroonga. This is because Mroonga requires newer
version of Groonga (8.0.1) to fix bugs, but it will not reloaded until
MySQL is restarted.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [rpm][centos] Supported Percona Server 5.6.39. [Reported by @iiiiyyyy]

* [rpm][centos] Supported Percona Server 5.7.21.

* [rpm][centos] Supported MariaDB 10.2.13. [GitHub#198] [Reported by
  shota suzuki]

* [rpm][centos] Supported MariaDB 10.2.14.

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug that wrong cache for other database is used. If you
  create multiple database and use `mroonga_command()` against one of
  them, wrong cache is returned unexpectedly. To fix this issue,
  Groonga 8.0.1 or later is required.

* Fixed a bug that "NOT IN" query returns empty result. This bug
  occurs when "NOT IN" is used with multiple arguments such as "NOT IN
  (xxx, xxx)"

* Fixed a bug that specified "NOT IN" can't exclude correctly when
  condition push down is enabled.

* Fixed a bug that "ORDER BY RAND()" query returns wrong result. This
  bug occurs when "ORDER BY RAND()" and "LIMIT" is specified at the
  same time.

* Fixed a bug that "fast order limit" optimization is applied
  unexpectedly to "ORDER BY function()".
