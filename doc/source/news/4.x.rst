Release 4.10 - 2015-01-29
-------------------------

This release has a bug fix for unique index. If you're using unique
index in storage mode, your data may be broken. If you're using unique
index in storage mode, we recommend to upgrade to this version and
re-create your unique indexes.

Here are SQL statements to re-create your indexes including unique
indexes::

    ALTER TABLE ${YOUR_TABLE} DISABLE KEYS;
    ALTER TABLE ${YOUR_TABLE} ENABLE KEYS;

You may get "duplicated record" error on ``ENABLE KEYS``. If you get
the error, please confirm your data carefully and fix the duplication.

Here are broken data scenario:

  * An unique index is created.
  * Insert data.
  * Insert duplicated data. It's reported as an error.
  * Insert duplicated data again. It can be inserted. It breaks unique
    consistency.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [storage] Supported static index construction in FULLTEXT
  INDEX comment with ``'table "XXX"'``. Execute ``DISABLE KEYS``, then
  ``ENABLE KEYS`` for static index construction.
  [Reported by Naoya Murakami]
* [rpm][centos] Built with MySQL 5.6.22 on CentOS 7.
  [groonga-dev,03047] [Reported by Hiroshi Kagami]
* [rpm][centos] Built with MariaDB 5.5.40-2 on CentOS 7.
* [storage][mysql56] Supported to report duplicated error
  for ``ADD UNIQUE INDEX``. [Reported by kazeburo]

Fixes
^^^^^

* [storage] Fixed a bug that referenced table is accidentally
  removed on error. This means that index creation is failed for
  FULLTEXT INDEX comment with ``'table "terms"'``, "terms"
  table can be removed on error.
* [storage] Fixed a bug that duplicated entry is removed in unique index
  when duplicated error is occurred. This bug makes consistency of indexes broken,
  so recommended to recreate existing indexes again after upgrading Mroonga. [Reported by kazeburo]
* [storage] Fixed a bug that ``INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`` is
  broken. This bug may change existing other records by executing update fallback when
  insert error occurred. [Reported by kazeburo]
