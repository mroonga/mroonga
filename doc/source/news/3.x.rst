Release 3.12 - 2014/01/29
-------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added a new system variable
  :ref:`server-variable-mroonga-lock-timeout`. By changing this global
  variable, You can customize Groonga's lock timeout dynamically.
* Improved compatibility with Tritonn 'W' pragma's behaviour.
  In the previous versions, Mroonga used omitted section as weight 0. By this change,
  Mroonga uses omitted section as weight 1. This behaviour is same as Tritonn.
  [#2152] [Patch by Kenji Maruyama]

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed a crash bug on FLUSH TABLES during SELECT MATCH AGAINST ... [#2137] [Reported by yoku]
* Fixed wrong implementation for "W" pragma. It was changed to 1-origin. [#2151]

  with Tritonn.
  This is incompatible change, please check existing query which use "W" pragma.
* Fixed a bug that searching empty records with "NOT" query returns duplicated results. [#2215]
